abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been applied to solve decision-making problems
  in computer network designs, especially in TCP congestion control. As RL-based congestion
  control methods enable powerful learning abilities, it achieves competitive performance
  and adaptiveness advantages over the traditional methods. However, RL-based systems
  suffer from adversarial attacks that generate perturbations to significantly degrade
  the performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of adversarial
  attacks against RL-based congestion control systems. Unlike the state-of-the-art
  adversarial attacks on images where an attacker can easily obtain the input states
  to introduce perturbations, the attacker cannot directly obtain the input states
  in congestion control settings that are only available to the agents. It is challenging
  to add effective perturbations without knowing the input states for RL-based congestion
  control models. To solve the challenge, we develop an adversarial attack to estimate
  states of the target agent, craft adversarial perturbations, and apply the generated
  perturbations in an automated fashion. We evaluate how our adversarial attack affects
  the target agent’s decision-making process. Our experiments illustrate that our
  attack can effectively reduce about 50% average throughput while increasing more
  than 36x latency and 45% packet loss rate.
