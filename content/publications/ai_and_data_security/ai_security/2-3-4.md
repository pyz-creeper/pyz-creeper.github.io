abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks, i.e.,
  imperceptible adversarial perturbations can easily give rise to wrong predictions,
  poses a huge threat to the security of their real-world deployments. In this paper,
  a novel Adversarial Detection method via Disentangling Natural images and Perturbations
  (ADDNP) is proposed. Compared to natural images that can typically be modeled by
  lower-dimensional subspaces or manifolds, the distributions of adversarial perturbations
  are much more complex, e.g., one normal example’s adversarial counterparts generated
  by different attack strategies can be significantly distinct. The proposed ADDNP
  exploits such distinct properties for the detection of adversarial attacks amongst
  normal examples. Specifically, we use a dual-branch disentangling framework to encode
  natural images and perturbations of inputs separately, followed by joint reconstruction.
  During inference, the reconstruction discrepancy (RD) measured in the learned latent
  feature space is used as an indicator of adversarial perturbations. The proposed
  ADDNP algorithm is evaluated on three popular datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
  and mini ImageNet with increasing data complexity, across multiple popular attack
  strategies. Compared to the existing and state-of-the-art detection methods, ADDNP
  has demonstrated promising performance on adversarial detection, with significant
  improvements on more challenging datasets.
