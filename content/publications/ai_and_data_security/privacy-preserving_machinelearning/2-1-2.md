abstract: 'Collaborative graph learning represents a learning paradigm where multiple
  parties jointly train a graph neural network (GNN) using their own proprietary graph
  data. To honor the data privacy of all parties, existing solutions for collaborative
  graph learning are either based on federated learning (FL) or secure machine learning
  (SML). Although promising in terms of efficiency and scalability due to their distributed
  training scheme, FL-based approaches fall short in providing provable security guarantees
  and achieving good model performance. Conversely, SML-based solutions, while offering
  provable privacy guarantees, are hindered by their high computational and communication
  overhead, as well as poor scalability as more parties participate.

  To address the above problem, we propose CoGNN, a novel framework that simultaneously
  reaps the benefits of both FL-based and SML-based approaches. At a high level, CoGNN
  is enabled by (i) a novel message passing mechanism that can obliviously and efficiently
  express the vertex data propagation/aggregation required in GNN training and inference
  and (ii) a two-stage Dispatch-Collect execution scheme to securely decompose and
  distribute the GNN computation workload for concurrent and scalable executions.
  We further instantiate the CoGNN framework, together with customized optimizations,
  to train Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models. Extensive evaluations on three
  graph datasets demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) SML-based
  approach, CoGNN reduces up to x running time and up to x communication cost per
  party. Meanwhile, the GCN models trained using CoGNN have nearly identical accuracies
  as the plaintext global-graph training, yielding up to accuracy improvement over
  the GCN models trained via federated learning.'
