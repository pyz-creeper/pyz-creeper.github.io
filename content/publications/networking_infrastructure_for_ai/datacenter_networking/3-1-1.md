abstract: For decades, Random Early Detection (RED) has been integrated into datacenter
  switches as a fundamental Active Queue Management (AQM). Accurate configuration
  of RED parameters is crucial to achieving high throughput and low latency. However,
  due to the highly dynamic nature of workloads in datacenter networks, maintaining
  consistently high performance with statically configured RED thresholds poses a
  challenge. Prior art applies reinforcement learning to predict proper thresholds,
  but their real-world deployment has been hindered by poor tail performance caused
  by instability. In this paper, we propose PRED, a novel system that enables automatic
  and stable RED parameter adjustment in response to traffic dynamics. PRED uses two
  loosely coupled systems, Flow Concurrent Stabilizer (FCS) and Queue Length Adjuster
  (QLA), to overcome the challenges of dynamically setting RED parameters to adapt
  to the ever-changing traffic pattern. We perform extensive evaluations on our physical
  testbed and large-scale simulations. The results demonstrate that PRED can keep
  up with the real-time network dynamics generated by realistic workloads. For instance,
  compared with the static-threshold-based methods, PRED keeps 66%lower switch queue
  length and obtains up to 80% lower Flow Completion Time (FCT). Compared with the
  state-of-the-art learning-based method, PRED reduces the tail FCT by 34%.
