abstract: 'ECN marking has been integrated into datacenter switches to enable high-throughput
  and low-latency transport. We observe that current marking schemes are coarse-grained:
  they blindly mark all flows when congestion occurs, causing large flows to occupy
  undeserved bandwidth and preventing newly arriving small flows from finishing quickly.
  In this paper, we propose DiffECN, a differential marking strategy that marks only
  the flows that are the culprits of congestion and protects the remaining flows from
  being limited. We have implemented it in the Barefoot Tofino switch and performed
  extensive evaluations via both physical testbed and large-scale simulations. The
  results show that DiffECN can restrain flows responsible for congestion successfully
  while providing desirable network performance. For instance, compared to the legacy
  way of ECN marking, DiffECN achieves up to 32.5% (40.1%) lower average (99th percentile)
  flow completion time (FCT) for small flows while delivering similar FCT for large
  flows under production workloads.'
