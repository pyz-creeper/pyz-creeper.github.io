abstract: 'With the advent of software-defined networking, network configuration through
  programmable interfaces becomes practical, leading to various on-demand opportunities
  for network routing update in multi-tenant datacenters, where tenants have diverse
  requirements on network routings such as short latency, low path inflation, large
  bandwidth, high reliability, etc. Conventional solutions that rely on topology search
  coupled with an objective function to find desired routings have at least two shortcomings:
  (i)(i) they run into scalability issues when handling consistent and frequent routing
  updates and (ii)(ii) they restrict the flexibility and capability to satisfy various
  routing requirements. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel search
  and optimization decoupled design, which not only saves considerable topology search
  costs via search result reuse, but also avoids possible sub-optimality in greedy
  routing search algorithms by making decisions based on the global view of all possible
  routings. We implement a prototype of our proposed system, OpReduce, and perform
  extensive evaluations to validate its design goals.'
