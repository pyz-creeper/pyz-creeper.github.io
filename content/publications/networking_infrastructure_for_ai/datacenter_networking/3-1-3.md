abstract: Despite the bandwidth scaling limit of electrical switching and the high
  cost of building Clos data center networks (DCNs), the adoption of optical DCNs
  is still limited. There are two reasons. First, existing optical DCN designs usually
  face high deployment complexity. Second, these designs are not full-optical and
  the performance benefit over the non-blocking Clos DCN is not clear. After exploring
  the design tradeoffs of the existing optical DCN designs, we propose TROD (Threshold
  Routing based Optical Datacenter), a low-complexity optical DCN with superior performance
  than other optical DCNs. There are two novel designs in TROD that contribute to
  its success. First, TROD performs robust topology optimization based on the recurring
  traffic patterns and thus does not need to react to every traffic change, which
  lowers deployment and management complexity. Second, TROD introduces tVLB (threshold-based
  Valiant Load Balance), which can avoid network congestion as much as possible even
  under unexpected traffic bursts. We conduct simulation based on both Facebook’s
  real DCN traces and our synthesized highly bursty DCN traces. TROD reduces flow
  completion time (FCT) by about 1.15- 2.16× compared to Google’s Jupiter DCN, at
  least 2× compared to other optical DCN designs, and about 2.4- 3.2× compared to
  expander graph DCN. Compared with the non-blocking Clos, TROD reduces the hop count
  of the majority packets by one, and could even outperform the non-blocking Clos
  with proper bandwidth over-provision at the optical layer. Note that TROD can be
  built with commercially available hardware and does not require host modifications.
