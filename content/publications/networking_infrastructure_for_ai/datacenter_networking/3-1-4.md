abstract: Today's cloud networks are shared among many tenants. Bandwidth guarantees
  and work conservation are two key properties to ensure predictable performance for
  tenant applications and high network utilization for providers. Despite significant
  efforts, very little prior work can really achieve both properties simultaneously
  even some of them claimed so. In this paper, we present QShare, a comprehensive
  in-network solution to achieve bandwidth guarantees and work conservation simultaneously.
  QShare leverages weighted fair queuing on commodity switches to slice network bandwidth
  for tenants, and solves the challenge of queue scarcity through balanced tenant
  placement and dynamic tenant-queue binding. We have implemented a QShare prototype
  and evaluated it extensively via both testbed experiments and simulations. Our results
  show that QShare ensures bandwidth guarantees while driving network utilization
  to over 91% even under unpredictable traffic demands.
