abstract: 'Automated management of a physical network''s lifecycle is critical for
  large networks. At Google, we manage network design, construction, evolution, and
  management via multiple automated systems. In our experience, one of the primary
  challenges is to reliably and efficiently manage change in this domain -- additions
  of new hardware and connectivity, planning and sequencing of topology mutations,
  introduction of new architectures, new software systems and fixes to old ones, etc.

  We especially have learned the importance of supporting multiple kinds of change
  in parallel without conflicts or mistakes (which cause outages) while also maintaining
  parallelism between different teams and between different processes. We now know
  that this requires automated support.

  This paper describes some of our network lifecycle goals, the automation we have
  developed to meet those goals, and the change-management challenges we encountered.
  We then discuss in detail our approaches to several specific kinds of change management:
  (1) managing conflicts between multiple operations on the same network; (2) managing
  conflicts between operations spanning the boundaries between networks; (3) managing
  representational changes in the models that drive our automated systems. These approaches
  combine both novel software systems and software-engineering practices.'
