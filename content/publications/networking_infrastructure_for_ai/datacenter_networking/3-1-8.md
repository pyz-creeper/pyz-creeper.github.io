abstract: Random Early Detection (RED) has been integrated into datacenter switches
  as a fundamental Active Queue Management (AQM) for decades. The accurate configuration
  of RED parameters is crucial to achieving high throughput and low latency. However,
  due to the highly dynamic nature of workloads in datacenter networks, maintaining
  consistently high performance with statically configured RED thresholds poses a
  challenge. Prior work applies reinforcement learning to predict proper thresholds,
  but their real-world deployment has been hindered by poor tail performance caused
  by instability. In this paper, we propose PRED , a novel system that enables automatic
  and stable RED parameter adjustment in response to traffic dynamics. Specifically,
  the system employs a Multiplicative-Increase Multiplicative-Decrease (MIMD) strategy
  to dynamically adapt to flow concurrency while utilizing an Additive-Increase Additive-Decrease
  (AIAD) mechanism to adapt to flow distribution. We perform extensive evaluations
  on our physical testbed and large-scale simulations. The results demonstrate that
  PRED can keep up with the real-time network dynamics generated by realistic workloads.
  For instance, compared with the static-threshold-based methods, PRED keeps 66% shorter
  switch queue length and obtains up to 80% lower Flow Completion Time (FCT). Compared
  with the state-of-the-art learning-based method, PRED reduces the tail FCT by 34%.
