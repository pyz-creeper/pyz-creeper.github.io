abstract: 'The emerging programmable networks sparked significant research on Intelligent
  Network Data Plane (INDP), which achieves learning-based traffic analysis at line-speed.
  Prior art in INDP focus on deploying tree/forest models on the data plane. We observe
  a fundamental limitation in tree-based INDP approaches: although it is possible
  to represent even larger tree/forest tables on the data plane, the flow features
  that are computable on the data plane are fundamentally limited by hardware constraints.
  In this paper, we present BoS to push the boundaries of INDP by enabling Neural
  Network (NN) driven traffic analysis at line-speed. Many types of NNs (such as Recurrent
  Neural Network (RNN), and transformers) that are designed to work with sequential
  data have advantages over tree-based models, because they can take raw network data
  as input without complex feature computations on the fly. However, the challenge
  is significant: the recurrent computation scheme used in RNN inference is fundamentally
  different from the match-action paradigm used on the network data plane. BoS addresses
  this challenge by (i) designing a novel data plane friendly RNN architecture that
  can execute unlimited RNN time steps with limited data plane stages, effectively
  achieving line-speed RNN inference; and (ii) complementing the on-switch RNN model
  with an off-switch transformer-based traffic analysis module to further boost the
  overall performance. We implement a prototype of BoS using a P4 programmable switch
  as our data plane, and extensively evaluate it over multiple traffic analysis tasks.
  The results show that BoS outperforms state-of-the-art in both analysis accuracy
  and scalability.'
