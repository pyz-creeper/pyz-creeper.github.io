abstract: Internet content providers often deliver content through bandwidth bottlenecks
  that are out of their control. Thus, despite often having massively over-provisioned
  upstream servers, the content providers still cannot control the end-to-end user
  experience. This paper explores remote traffic shaping, allowing the content provider
  to allocate its share of a remote bottleneck link across its users using a metric
  other than TCP fairness, while remaining TCP-friendly to cross traffic on the bottleneck
  link. To evaluate this approach, we designed FlowTele, the first system that shapes
  outbound traffic on an Internet-scale network to optimize provider-selected metrics,
  using source control with neither in-network support nor special client support.
  Our extensive evaluations over the Internet show that by strategically reallocating
  bandwidth among provider-owned co-bottlenecked flows, FlowTele improves the provider's
  total revenue by roughly 20%--30% in various network settings, compared with both
  (i) status quo TCP fairshare and (ii) recent practice by content providers that
  proactively throttles video quality during the COVID-19 pandemic, while being TCP-friendly
  to cross-traffic. Besides revenue, we also study other metrics, such as QoE fairness,
  that a content provider may wish to optimize using FlowTele.
