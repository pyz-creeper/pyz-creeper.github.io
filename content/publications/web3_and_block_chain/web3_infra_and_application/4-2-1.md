abstract: 'Web3.0, often cited to drastically shape our lives, is ubiquitous. However,
  few literatures have discussed the crucial differentiators that separate Web3.0
  from the era we are currently living in. Via a thorough analysis of the recent blockchain
  infrastructure evolution, we capture a key invariant featuring the evolution, based
  on which we provide the first academic definition for Web3.0. Our definition is
  not the only way of understanding Web3.0, yet, it captures the fundamental and defining
  trait of Web3.0, and meanwhile it is has two desirable properties. Under this definition,
  we articulate three key categories of infrastructural enablers for Web3.0: individual
  smart-contract capable blockchains, federated or centralized platforms capable of
  publishing verifiable states, and an interoperability platform to hyperconnect those
  state publishers to provide a unified and connected computing platform for Web3.0
  applications. While innovations in all categories are necessary to fully enable
  Web3.0, in this paper, we present a design for the third enabler, i.e., the first
  interoperability platform, namely HyperService, that advances the state-of-the-art
  by simultaneously delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous
  blockchains and state publishers. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs:
  (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain
  applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing
  cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains.
  We implement a prototype of HyperService in approximately 62,000 lines of code to
  demonstrate its practicality, usability and scalability'
