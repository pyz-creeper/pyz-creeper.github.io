abstract: Embracing software-driven smart contracts to fulfill legal agreements is
  a promising direction for digital transformation in the legal sector. Existing solutions
  mostly consider smart contracts as simple add-ons, without leveraging the programmability
  of smart contracts to realize complex semantics of legal agreements. In this paper,
  we propose iSyn, the first end-to-end system that synthesizes smart contracts to
  fulfill the semantics of financial legal agreements, with minimal human interventions.
  The design of iSyn centers around a novel intermediate representation (SmartIR)
  that closes the gap between the natural language sentences and smart contract statements.
  Specifically, iSyn includes a synergistic pipeline that unifies multiple NLP-techniques
  to accurately construct SmartIR instances given legal agreements, and performs template-based
  synthesis based on the SmartIR instances to synthesize smart contracts. We also
  design a validation framework to verify the correctness and detect known vulnerabilities
  of the synthesized smart contracts. We evaluate iSyn using legal agreements centering
  around financial transactions. The results show that iSyn-synthesized smart contracts
  are syntactically similar and semantically correct (or within a few edits), compared
  with the "ground truth" smart contracts manually developed by inspecting the legal
  agreements.
