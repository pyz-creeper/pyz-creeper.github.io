abstract: 'The development of machine learning models requires a large amount of training
  data. Data marketplace is a critical platform to trade high-quality and private-domain
  data that is not publicly available on the Internet. However, as data privacy becomes
  increasingly important, directly exchanging raw data becomes inappropriate. Federated
  Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that exchanges data utilities
  (in form of local models or gradients) among multiple parties without directly sharing
  the original data. However, we recognize several key challenges in applying existing
  FL architectures to construct a data marketplace. (i) In existing FL architectures,
  the Data Acquirer (DA) cannot privately assess the quality of local models submitted
  by different Data Providers (DPs) prior to trading; (ii)The model aggregation protocols
  in existing FL designs cannot effectively exclude malicious DPs without "overfitting"
  to the DA''s (possibly biased) root dataset; (iii) Prior FL designs lack a proper
  billing mechanism to enforce the DA to fairly allocate the reward according to contributions
  made by different DPs. To address above challenges, we propose martFL, the first
  federated learning architecture that is specifically designed to enable a secure
  utility-driven data marketplace. At a high level, martFL is empowered by two innovative
  designs: (i) a quality-aware model aggregation protocol that allows the DA to properly
  exclude local-quality or even poisonous local models from the aggregation, even
  if the DA''s root dataset is biased; (ii) a verifiable data transaction protocol
  that enables the DA to prove, both succinctly and in zero-knowledge, that it has
  faithfully aggregated these local models according to the weights that the DA has
  committed to. This enables the DPs to unambiguously claim the rewards proportional
  to their weights/contributions. We implement a prototype of martFL and evaluate
  it extensively over various tasks. The results show that martFL can improve the
  model accuracy by up to 25% while saving up to 64% data acquisition cost.'
