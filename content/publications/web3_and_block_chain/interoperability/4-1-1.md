abstract: 'Blockchain interoperability, which allows state transitions across different
  blockchain networks, is critical functionality to facilitate major blockchain adoption.
  Existing interoperability protocols mostly focus on atomic token exchanges between
  blockchains. However, as blockchains have been upgraded from passive distributed
  ledgers into programmable state machines (thanks to smart contracts), the scope
  of blockchain interoperability goes beyond just token exchanges. In this paper,
  we present HyperService, the first platform that delivers interoperability and programmability
  across heterogeneous blockchains. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs:
  (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain
  applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing
  cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains.
  We implement a prototype of HyperService in approximately 35,000 lines of code to
  demonstrate its practicality. Our experiments show that (i) HyperService imposes
  reasonable latency, in order of seconds, on the end-to-end execution of cross-chain
  applications; (ii) the HyperService platform is scalable to continuously incorporate
  new large-scale production blockchains.'
