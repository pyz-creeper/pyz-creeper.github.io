abstract: 'In Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack, a local passive eavesdropper utilizes
  network flow information to identify which web pages a user is browsing. Previous
  researchers have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of WF attacks under
  a strong Single Page Assumption: the network flow extracted by the adversary belongs
  to a single web page. In reality, the assumption may not hold because users tend
  to open multiple tabs simultaneously (or within a short period of time) so that
  their network traffic is mixed. In this article, we propose an automated multi-tab
  Website Fingerprinting attack that is able to accurately classify websites regardless
  of the number of simultaneously opened pages. Our design is powered by two innovative
  designs. First, we develop a split point classification method to dynamically identify
  the split point between the first page and its subsequent pages. As a result, the
  network traffic before the split point is solely generated for the first page. Then,
  we propose a new chunk-based WF classifier to infer the websites based on the initial
  chunk of clean traffic. For both classifiers, we apply automated feature selection
  to select a concise yet representative feature set. We implement a prototype of
  our design and perform extensive evaluations using SSH and Tor-based datasets to
  demonstrate the effectiveness of both our system components individually and the
  integrated system as a whole.'
