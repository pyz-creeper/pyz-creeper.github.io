abstract: 'Learning-based traffic analysis models exhibit significant vulnerabilities
  to adversarial attacks. Attackers can compromise these models by generating adversarial
  network flows with precisely optimized perturbations. These perturbations typically
  take two forms: additive modifications, which include packet length padding and
  timing delays, and discrete alterations, such as dummy packet insertion. In response
  to these threats, certified robustness has emerged as a promising methodology for
  ensuring reliable model performance in the presence of adversarially manipulated
  network traffic. However, current approaches inadequately address the multi-modal
  nature of adversarial perturbations in network traffic, resulting in limited robustness
  guarantees against sophisticated attacks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
  CertTA, the first solution providing certifiable robustness against multi-modal
  adversarial attacks in traffic analysis models. CertTA incorporates a novel multi-modal
  smoothing mechanism that explicitly accounts for attack-induced perturbations during
  the generation of smoothing samples, based on which CertTA rigorously derives robustness
  regions that are meaningful against these attacks. We implement a prototype of CertTA
  and extensively evaluate it against three categories of multi-modal adversarial
  attacks across six traffic analysis models and two datasets. Our experimental results
  demonstrate that CertTA provides significantly stronger robustness guarantees than
  the state-of-the-art approaches when confronting adversarial attacks. Further, CertTA
  is universally applicable across diverse model architectures and flow representations.'
