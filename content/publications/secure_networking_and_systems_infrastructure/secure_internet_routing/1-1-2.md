abstract: The Internet inter-domain routing system is vulnerable. On the control plane,
  the de facto Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) does not have built-in mechanisms to
  authenticate routing announcements, so an adversary can announce virtually arbitrary
  paths to hijack network traffic; on the data plane, it is difficult to ensure that
  actual forwarding path complies with the control plane decisions. The community
  has proposed significant research to secure the routing system. Yet, existing secure
  BGP protocols (e.g., BGPsec) are not incrementally deployable, and existing path
  authorization protocols are not compatible with the current Internet routing infrastructure.
  In this paper, we propose FC-BGP, the first secure Internet inter-domain routing
  system that can simultaneously authenticate BGP announcements and validate data
  plane forwarding in an efficient and incrementally-deployable manner. FC-BGP is
  built upon a novel primitive, name Forwarding Commitment, to certify an AS's routing
  intent on its directly connected hops. We analyze the security benefits of FC-BGP
  in the Internet at different deployment rates. Further, we implement a prototype
  of FC-BGP and extensively evaluate it over a large-scale overlay network with 100
  virtual machines deployed globally. The results demonstrate that FC-BGP saves roughly
  55% of the overhead required to validate BGP announcements compared with BGPsec,
  and meanwhile FC-BGP introduces a small overhead for building a globally-consistent
  view on the desirable forwarding paths.
