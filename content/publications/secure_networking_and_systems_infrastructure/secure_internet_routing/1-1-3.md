abstract: The Internet lacks verification of source authenticity and path compliance
  between the planned packet delivery paths and the real delivery paths, which allows
  attackers to construct attacks like source spoofing and traffic hijacking attacks.
  Thus, it is essential to enable source and path verification in networks to detect
  forwarding anomalies and ensure correct packet delivery. However, most of the existing
  security mechanisms can only capture anomalies but are unable to locate the detected
  anomalies. Besides, they incur significant computation and communication overhead,
  which exacerbates the packet delivery performance. In this paper, we propose a high-efficient
  packet forwarding verification mechanism called PPV for networks, which verifies
  packet source and their forwarding paths in real time. PPV enables probabilistic
  packet marking in routers instead of verifying all packets. Thus, it can efficiently
  identify forwarding anomalies by verifying markings. Moreover, it localizes packet
  forwarding anomalies, e.g., malicious routers, by reconstructing packet forwarding
  paths based on the packet markings. We implement PPV prototype in Click routers
  and commodity servers, and conducts real experiments in a real testbed built upon
  the prototype. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and performance
  of PPV. In particular, PPV significantly improves the throughput and the goodput
  of forwarding verification, and achieves around 2 times and 3 times improvement
  compared with the-state-of-art OPT scheme, respectively.
