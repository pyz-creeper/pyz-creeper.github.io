abstract: The extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) provides powerful and flexible
  kernel interfaces to extend the kernel functions for user space programs via running
  bytecode directly in the kernel space. It has been widely used by cloud services
  to enhance container security, network management, and system observability. However,
  we discover that the offensive eBPF that have been extensively discussed in Linux
  hosts can bring new attack surfaces to containers. With eBPF tracing features, attackers
  can break the container's isolation and attack the host, e.g., steal sensitive data,
  DoS, and even escape the container. In this paper, we study the eBPF-based cross
  container attacks and reveal their security impacts in real world services. With
  eBPF attacks, we successfully compromise five online Jupyter/Interactive Shell services
  and the Cloud Shell of Google Cloud Platform. Furthermore, we find that the Kubernetes
  services offered by three leading cloud vendors can be exploited to launch cross-node
  attacks after the attackers escape the container via eBPF. Specifically, in Alibaba's
  Kubernetes services, attackers can compromise the whole cluster by abusing their
  over-privileged cloud metrics or management Pods. Unfortunately, the eBPF attacks
  on containers are seldom known and can hardly be discovered by existing intrusion
  detection systems. Also, the existing eBPF permission model cannot confine the eBPF
  and ensure secure usage in shared-kernel container environments. To this end, we
  propose a new eBPF permission model to counter the eBPF attacks in containers.
