abstract: Nowadays real-time embedded devices are becoming one main target of cyber
  attacks. A huge number of embedded devices equipped with outdated firmware are subject
  to various vulnerabilities, but they cannot be timely patched due to two main reasons.
  First, it is difficult for vendors who have various types of fragmented devices
  to generate patches for each type of device. Second, it is challenging to deploy
  patches on many embedded devices without restarting or halting real-time tasks,
  hindering the patch installation on devices (e.g., industrial control devices) that
  have high availability requirements. In this paper, we present RapidPatch, a new
  hotpatching framework to facilitate patch propagation by installing generic patches
  without disrupting other tasks running on heterogeneous embedded devices. RapidPatch
  allows RTOS developers to directly release common patches for all downstream devices
  so that device maintainers can easily generate device-specific patches for different
  firmware. We utilize eBPF virtual machines to execute patches on resource-constrained
  embedded devices and develop three hotpatching strategies to support hotpatching
  for all major microcontroller (MCU) architectures. In particular, we propose two
  types of eBPF patches for different types of vulnerabilities and develop an eBPF
  patch verifier to ensure patch safety. We evaluate RapidPatch with major CVEs on
  four major RTOSes running on different embedded devices. We find that over 90% vulnerabilities
  can be hotpatched via RapidPatch. Our system can work on devices with 64 KB or more
  memory and 64 MHz MCU frequency. The average patch delay is less than 8 µs and the
  overall latency overhead is less than 0.6%.
