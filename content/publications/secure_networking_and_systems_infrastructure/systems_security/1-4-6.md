abstract: Tor is the most widely used anonymity network, currently serving millions
  of users each day. However, there is no access control in place for all these users,
  leaving the network vulnerable to botnet abuse and attacks. For example, criminals
  frequently use exit relays as stepping stones for attacks, causing service providers
  to serve CAPTCHAs to exit relay IP addresses or blacklisting them altogether, which
  leads to severe usability issues for legitimate Tor users. To address this problem,
  we propose TorPolice, the first privacy-preserving access control framework for
  Tor. TorPolice enables abuse-plagued service providers such as Yelp to enforce access
  rules to police and throttle malicious requests coming from Tor while still providing
  service to legitimate Tor users. Further, TorPolice equips Tor with global access
  control for relays, enhancing Tor's resilience to botnet abuse. We show that TorPolice
  preserves the privacy of Tor users, implement a prototype of TorPolice, and perform
  extensive evaluations to validate our design goals.
