abstract: Defending against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet
  is a fundamental problem. However, recent industrial interviews with over 100 security
  experts from more than ten industry segments indicate that DDoS problems have not
  been fully addressed. The reasons are twofold. On one hand, many academic proposals
  that are provably secure witness little real-world deployment. On the other hand,
  the operation model for existing DDoS-prevention service providers (e.g., Cloudflare,
  Akamai) is privacy invasive for large organizations (e.g., government). In this
  paper, we present Umbrella, a new DDoS defense mechanism enabling Internet service
  providers to offer readily deployable and privacy-preserving DDoS prevention services
  to their customers. At its core, Umbrella develops a multi-layered defense architecture
  to defend against a wide spectrum of DDoS attacks. In particular, the flood throttling
  layer stops amplification-based DDoS attacks; the congestion resolving layer, aiming
  to prevent sophisticated attacks that cannot be easily filtered, enforces congestion
  accountability to ensure that legitimate flows are guaranteed to receive their fair
  shares regardless of attackers' strategies; and finally the user-specific layer
  allows DDoS victims to enforce self-desired traffic control policies that best satisfy
  their business requirements. Based on Linux implementation, we demonstrate that
  Umbrella is capable to deal with large-scale attacks involving millions of attack
  flows, meanwhile imposing negligible packet processing overhead. Further, our physical
  test bed experiments and large-scale simulations prove that Umbrella is effective
  to mitigate various DDoS attacks.
