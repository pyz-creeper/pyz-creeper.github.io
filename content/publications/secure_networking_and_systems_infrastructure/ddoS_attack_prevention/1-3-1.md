abstract: Volumetric attacks, which overwhelm the bandwidth of a destination, are
  amongst the most common DDoS attacks today. One practical approach to addressing
  these attacks is to redirect all destination traffic (e.g., via DNS or BGP) to a
  third-party, DDoS-protection-as-a-service provider (e.g., CloudFlare) that is well
  provisioned and equipped with filtering mechanisms to remove attack traffic before
  passing the remaining benign traffic to the destination. An alternative approach
  is based on the concept of network capabilities, whereby source sending rates are
  determined by receiver consent, in the form of capabilities enforced by the network.
  While both third-party scrubbing services and network capabilities can be effective
  at reducing unwanted traffic at an overwhelmed destination, DDoS-protection-as-a-service
  solutions outsource all of the scheduling decisions (e.g., fairness, priority and
  attack identification) to the provider, while capability-based solutions require
  extensive modifications to existing infrastructure to operate. In this paper we
  introduce MiddlePolice, which seeks to marry the deployability of DDoS-protection-as-a-service
  solutions with the destination-based control of network capability systems. We show
  that by allowing feedback from the destination to the provider, MiddlePolice can
  effectively enforce destination-chosen policies, while requiring no deployment from
  unrelated parties.
