abstract: Volumetric attacks, which overwhelm the bandwidth of a destination, are
  among the most common distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks today. Despite
  considerable effort made by both research and industry, our recent interviews with
  over 100 potential DDoS victims in over 10 industry segments indicate that today's
  DDoS prevention is far from perfect. On one hand, few academical proposals have
  ever been deployed in the Internet; on the other hand, solutions offered by existing
  DDoS prevention vendors are not silver bullet to defend against the entire attack
  spectrum. Guided by such large-scale study of today's DDoS defense, in this paper,
  we present MiddlePolice, the first readily deployable and proactive DDoS prevention
  mechanism. We carefully architect MiddlePolice such that it requires no changes
  from both the Internet core and the network stack of clients, yielding instant deployability
  in the current Internet architecture. Further, relying on our novel capability feedback
  mechanism, MiddlePolice is able to enforce destination-driven traffic control so
  that it guarantees to deliver victim-desired traffic regardless of the attacker
  strategies. We implement a prototype of MiddlePolice and demonstrate its feasibility
  via extensive evaluations in the Internet, hardware testbed, and large-scale simulations.
