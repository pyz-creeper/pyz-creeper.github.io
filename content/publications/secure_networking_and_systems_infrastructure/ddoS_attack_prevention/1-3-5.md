abstract: Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a new networking paradigm to enable
  dynamic network function deployment in networks. Existing studies focused on optimized
  function deployment and management in NFV. Unfortunately, these studies did not
  well address the problem of efficient security function enforcement in networks,
  which is the goal of deploying network functions (NFs), i.e., for real-time security
  function enforcement on the traffic, since optimal function deployment does not
  mean efficient security function enforcement on network traffic. In particular,
  they incurred significant NF enforcement cost. In order to address this issue, in
  this paper, we propose FuncE that aims to solve the efficient real-time security
  function enforcement problem by developing unified dynamic flow and function scheduling.
  We formulate the problem as an integer linear programming problem and prove that
  it is NP-hard. We tackle the problem by decomposing it and developing heuristics
  to achieve near-optimal solutions. We conduct comprehensive experiments by using
  real topologies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the FuncE design. The experimental
  results demonstrate that FuncE achieves near-optimal network function enforcement,
  which incurs over 100 times less latency than the existing the optimal solver. In
  particular, compared to the state-of-art defenses, FuncE processes the same number
  of candidate flows using over 50% less VNFs, while ensuring the same level of function
  enforcement.
