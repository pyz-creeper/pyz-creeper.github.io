abstract: Defending against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is a fundamental
  problem in the Internet. Over the past few decades, the research and industry communities
  have proposed a variety of solutions, from adding incremental capabilities to the
  existing Internet routing stack, to clean-slate future Internet architectures, and
  to widely deployed commercial DDoS prevention services. Yet a recent interview with
  over 100 security practitioners in multiple sectors reveals that existing solutions
  are still insufficient against , due to either unenforceable protocol deployment
  or non-comprehensive traffic filters. This seemingly endless arms race with attackers
  probably means that we need a fundamental paradigm shift. In this paper, we propose
  a new DDoS prevention paradigm named preference-driven and in-network enforced traffic
  shaping , aiming to explore the novel DDoS prevention norms that focus on delivering
  victim-preferred traffic rather than consistently chasing after the DDoS attacks.
  Towards this end, we propose DFNet , a novel DDoS prevention system that provides
  reliable delivery of victim-preferred traffic without full knowledge of DDoS attacks.
  At a very high level, the core innovative design of DFNet embraces the advances
  in Machine Learning (ML) and new network dataplane primitives, by encoding the victim’s
  traffic preference (in the form of complex ML models) into dataplane packet scheduling
  algorithms such that the victim-preferred traffic is forwarded with priority at
  line-speed, regardless of the attacker strategy. We implement a prototype of DFNet
  in 11,560 lines of code, and extensively evaluate it on our testbed. The results
  show that a single instance of DFNetDFNet can forward 99.93% of victim-desired traffic
  when facing previously unseen attacks, while imposing less than 0.1% forwarding
  overhead on a dataplane with 80 Gbps upstream links and a 40 Gbps bottleneck.
